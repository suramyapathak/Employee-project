# Employee project

This project aimed at implementing basic automation functionalities within workflows. The initial phase involves streamlining the onboarding process for new employees, wherein the HR personnel enter relevant details into a Google Spreadsheet. Subsequently, based on this information, a unique user ID is assigned to the newcomer, and a welcome email is dispatched. The compiled data is then systematically recorded in a separate spreadsheet containing comprehensive details of all employees.
